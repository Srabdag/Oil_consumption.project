# Introduction
✅ Dive into the oil consumption! Focusing on each country across the world, 🌍 this project explores the highest to lowest consumption of oil from each country, 📊 the extraction of complex data, 📈 and where different countries have different consumption rates for oil.

# Background
The project was inspired by a desire to identify the changes in oil consumption by country and by year, with the goal of better navigating the oil consumption market.

Data derives from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadroshaanriaz/oil-reserves-and-consumption-from-1995-to-2022) It's packed with insights on per-year oil consumption, countries, location, and overall consumption per continent.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my analysis were:
1. Total Oil Consumption by Country/Region (COMPLETED)
2. Annual Oil Consumption by Country/Region (COMPLETED)
3. Year-over-Year Change (COMPLETED)
4. Trend Analysis (COMPLETED)
5. Regional Comparisons
6. Growth Rate

IN PROGRESS>>>>
