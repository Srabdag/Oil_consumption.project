# Introduction
🛢️ Dive into the oil consumption! Focusing on each country across the world, 🌍 this project explores the highest to lowest consumption of oil from each country, 📊 the extraction of complex data, 📈 and where different countries have different consumption rates for oil.

# Background
The project was inspired by a desire to identify the changes in oil consumption by country and by year, with the goal of better navigating the oil consumption market.

Data derives from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadroshaanriaz/oil-reserves-and-consumption-from-1995-to-2022) It's packed with insights on per-year oil consumption, countries, location, and overall consumption per continent.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my analysis were:
1. Total Oil Consumption by Country/Region
2. Annual Oil Consumption by Country/Region 
3. Year-over-Year Change 
4. Trend Analysis 
5. Regional Comparisons 
6. Growth Rate 

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst oil consumption, I used the power of several key tools:

- **Python:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query and code the database and unearth critical insights using pandas/matplotlib.
- **MySQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my Python/SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst of oil consuption across Countries/Region. Here’s how I approached each question:
